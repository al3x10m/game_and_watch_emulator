# Emulator for the Game and Watch

## Starting

`python3 -m emulator --hex <hexfile>` if you have a Intel HEX file

`python3 -m emulator --bin` if you have the files `flash_backup.bin`, `internal_flash_backup.bin` and `itcm_backup.bin` from the original dumps.

## Current State

Retro-Go: Main menu works kinda, starting games don't work yet

Original firmware: Doesn't work yet

Reaction to key presses are lagging, need to hold down the key for a single press
